Java 8, JavaFX Tutorial
=======================

This is the product of following the 7 part [JavaFX Tutorial by code.makery](http://code.makery.ch/java/javafx-8-tutorial-part1/) written by Marco Jakob. It is a great introduction to JavaFX and I highly recommend following along.

The tutorial uses Eclipse, but I followed along using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

### Things I added:
- Double click list items to edit.
- Responsive layout
- isFieldEmpty() Helper method to keep things a little more DRY
